The main goal of this project is to develop a simple cloud-based crop information and assistance system that helps farmers and users access crop data, weather updates, and market prices through an easy-to-use web interface. The system uses a Streamlit dashboard for interaction, AWS DynamoDB for storing crop records, and an NLP module for understanding user queries. It aims to provide quick and accessible agricultural insights using cloud and AI technologies.
